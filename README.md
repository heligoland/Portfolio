# 🌟 My Developer Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio repository — a growing collection of projects created as I learn, experiment, and refine my skills as a developer. This space showcases my journey from foundational programming concepts to more structured, real‑world problem‑solving.  

I approach each project with curiosity, analytical thinking, and a commitment to writing clean, well‑structured code. Many of the projects here come from my coursework and assignments, each one helping me build confidence in algorithms, data structures, file handling, automation, and version control.
